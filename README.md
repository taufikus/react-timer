## What's This All About?

This project features a customizable timer component built with React. It's not just your average timer - it comes with **a sleek design and some cool features like start, pause, and reset functionality, also with audio feedback functionality when the last 10 seconds remain**, and a Storybook for the component.

## Key Features

- **Audio Feedback:** for last remaining 10 seconds
- **User-friendly Controls:** Easy to use start, pause, and reset buttons
- **Visual Feedback:** Watch the progress circle fill up as time passes
- **Eye-catching Animation:** When the timer ends, enjoy a funky green and red flashing animation!
- **Storybook:** Used for making the component usage isolated


## How to Use

Just import the Timer component and use it like this:

```javascript
import Timer from './Timer';

<Timer title="My Timer" endTime={60} elapsedTime={0} />
```

## Props

**title (required):** Give your timer a snazzy name
**endTime (required):** Set how long the timer should run (in seconds)
**elapsedTime (optional):** Start the timer part-way through if you want

## Tech Stack

**React**
**Vite (for super-fast builds)**
**CSS for styling**
**Storybook**
